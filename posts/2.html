Modern Education #1: Organizations Establishing a Dominion Through Public Instruction Accords
<h2>Texas Instruments</h2>
<p>Ever since the appearance of graphing calculators in math classrooms, Texas Instruments (TI) has maintained a grasp on the market. Similarly, Casio controls the market for graphing calculators in other countries, and although Casio developed the first compact calculator, Texas Instruments quickly followed and made several accords with state governments. The differences TI made to their calculators were unobtrusive; TI calculators followed the standards created by Casio. Immediately after striking a deal with the state of Connecticut for 10,000 calculators<sup><a href="#mashable">[1]</a></sup>, Texas Instruments saw the potential in selling school mandated graphing calculators in the United States and continued to make deals countrywide. After these dealings were made, TI rose to become one of the biggest calculator manufacturers to date, with schools and teachers advocating these calculators through course supply lists. In addition, multiple independent organizations were developing standardized tests which also made owning a TI calculator necessary, and "College Board" is one of them.</p>
<h2>College Board</h2>
<p>If you've gone through any amount of public instruction in the United States, you've likely dealt with the "non-profit" organization "College Board" in some manner. Founded in 1899, College Board established the earliest forms of standardized testing, and while it has faced a profusion of apprehensive teachers and parents, it is still the leading standardized test producer in the United States. If you want to enter any university in the United States, having an SAT score is a necessity. Its second most notable program is the Advanced Placement program. College Board underhandedly sells students' information to anyone or any organization willing to pay $0.43 per student.<sup><a href="#collegeboard_info">[2]</a></sup> Recently, it was unveiled that College Board sells student information to a military recruitment program created by the Department of Defense.<sup><a href="#collegeboard_military">[3]</a></sup></p>
