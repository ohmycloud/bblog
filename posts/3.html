<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Slint was a Kentucky rock band formed by a set of young musicians in 1986. They are primarily known for releasing the essential post-rock era album "Spiderland". "Tweez" is a precursor to Spiderland, and is much rougher sounding. The album consists of Brian McMahan (vocals/guitar), David Pajo (guitar), and Britt Walford (drums/vocals). The boys all went to an experimental high school in which the students were treated more like adults. Britt Walford's parents later described the boys as "inseparable" and "intense".</p>
<p>I strongly encourage anyone who is interested in this band to watch the documentary "Breadcrumb Trail".</p>
<h2>The Incredibly Sinister Sound</h2>
<p>The progressive nature of each track in this album speaks cold, sinister "stories". The intent of these stories is left widely open to the listener's judgment. In each of the original tracks the opening consists of clean, ominous guitar riffs. The haunting vocals begin soft, spoken in a hushed (yet abrasive in nature) tone, although the tension builds to the point that Walford is yelling (distanced from the microphone). The tension builds up, only to be released in the form of spiraling, distorted guitar chords (primarily in the first, second, and fourth tracks).</p>
<h2>Feelings That Were Struck</h2>
<p>This section is strictly my personal experience with the album. The central point of Spiderland, to me, is about the members (primarily McMahan and Walford) expressing the feelings that arise when adolescents realize the unwelcoming nature of life. The stark contrast in the nature of assumed childhood innocence and existential fears is crucial in forming the frigid theme.</p>
<h2>In The Mind of Brian McMahan</h2>
<p>Clearly depression is a key takeaway from the album. In my mind, this is somewhat accountable to the embrace of the aforementioned contrasting ideas of innocence and dark existential thoughts. On a trip to a recording session, McMahan got into a near-death car accident. This, according to McMahan, pushed him deeper into depression as his "mortality hit home". The amount of emotion expressed in McMahan's recording sessions gave the other band members "chills", according to Pajo, and after the recordings were finished, Brian McMahan checked himself into a hospital.</p>
